# Using BlockWallet

BlockWallet is the first wallet to partner with RPCh and integrate with RPCh Alpha! Downloading BlockWallet will give you complete privacy when making transactions on Gnosis. You can download BlockWallet from either the Chrome webstore or GitHub.

**Note:** This version of the integration only uses RPCh Alpha for Gnosis chain transactions. To use RPCh with a different wallet or chain, you can use our Docker connector to run RPCh locally. A guide for this can be found [here.](./Using-RPCh-with-your-own-wallet.md)

## Download from the Chrome Webstore

(**1**) Find the latest BlockWallet release on the Webstore or just click [here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blockwallet/bopcbmipnjdcdfflfgjdgdjejmgpoaab)

(**2**) Simply add the extension to your browser

**Note:** The following instructions are for Chrome, but a similar set of instructions can be followed for any alternative browser.

(**1**) Locate the BlockWallet.zip file in the assets of this GitHub page, or click [here](./blockwallet-beta.zip) to download the folder.
