# Using BlockWallet

You can use RPCh on the Gnosis chain through BlockWallet. This is the easiest way to use RPCh. It is integrated in their latest release, which you can download from the Chrome web store or GitHub.

Alternatively, you can use Docker to run RPCh locally and use RPCh on any wallet or chain. A guide on how to use our Docker connector can be found [here.](./Using-RPCh-with-your-own-wallet.md)

## Download from the Chrome Webstore

(**1**) Find the latest BlockWallet release on the Webstore or just click [here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blockwallet/bopcbmipnjdcdfflfgjdgdjejmgpoaab)

(**2**) Simply add the extension to your browser
