# Running An RPCh Node

All HOPR node runners will be able to run an RPCh node with RPCh Beta. Currently, only nodes controlled by the HOPR association are used as entry/exit RPCh nodes for RPCh Alpha.

## What do RPCh nodes do?

Being an RPCh node runner means you opt your HOPR node in as an entry or exit node for RPCh relays. Depending on which node you register as, you will perform separate, added functionality beyond what a normal HOPR node does.

This is mainly in relation to exit nodes, which must process, re-route and encrypt responses in addition to processing requests. You can read about the architecture of this [here.](../tutorial-basics/Exit-Node.md)

## How to run an RPCh node

To run an RPCh node, first, you must be running a HOPR node. You can find the details for this [here.](https://docs.hoprnet.org/node/start-here) 

If you are running a HOPR node, you can register to run an RPCh node through the discovery platform once RPCh Beta is released. This page will be updated with instructions upon the release of RPCh Beta. 

## Incentives for RPCh node runners

RPCh entry/exit nodes must use the HOPR network to send data to each other, which costs HOPR tokens. So they are pre-funded with tokens for each relay and given an extra amount as an incentive to operate as an RPCh node. 

This mechanism will only be available to non-HOPR-controlled nodes upon the release of RPCh Beta and, as such, will be updated upon its release.
